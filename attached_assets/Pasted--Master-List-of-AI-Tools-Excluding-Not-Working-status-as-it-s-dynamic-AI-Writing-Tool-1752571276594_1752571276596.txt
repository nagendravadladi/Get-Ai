  const mostUsedTools = allAiTools.filter(tool => tool.status === "Most Used");

  const underratedWritingTools = allAiTools.filter(tool => 
    tool.category === "AI Writing Tools" && tool.status === "Underrated"
  );

  For "Limited Tokens Free" (which you mentioned in your initial request):
  You would typically combine the "Limited Free" access filter with a separate flag or description check
  on your tool entries. In this data, `access: "Limited Free"` serves this purpose.
