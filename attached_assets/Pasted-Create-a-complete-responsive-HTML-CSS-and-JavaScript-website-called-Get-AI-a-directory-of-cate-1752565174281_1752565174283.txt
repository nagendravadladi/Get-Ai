Create a complete responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website called “Get AI” — a directory of categorized AI tools with interactive filters and mobile-friendly design.

🧠 Homepage Structure:

1. Fixed top navigation bar with:
   - Left: “Get AI” logo (styled like a logo with border). Clicking it goes to the homepage.
   - Center: Search bar to search tools by name or category.
   - Right: Buttons — “Home,” “Categories” (with hover dropdown), “Theme toggle” (🌗), and “Language switch” (🌍).

2. Below nav, show a centered welcome message:
   “🧠 Tell us what you need — we’ll help you Get the AI you want!”
   Subtext below: “All information is curated from public data on the internet.”

3. Below that, display multiple full-width category sections (Netflix-style scrollable rows), each with:
   - Category title (e.g. “✍️ AI Writing Tools”)
   - Horizontal scrollable list of responsive tool cards

Each **AI tool card** includes:
   - Logo/icon (left or top)
   - Name of the tool
   - 2–3 line description
   - ✅ or ❌ emoji for “Currently Working”
   - 🔥 or 💤 emoji for “Most Used” or “Underrated”
   - Badge: Free / Limited Free / Paid
   - “Visit Tool” button (opens in new tab)
   - Responsive design for mobile/desktop
   - Clean shadow and hover animation

4. At the end of each category row: “View More” button opens full category page

🧩 Category Page:
- Title of category at top (e.g. “✍️ AI Writing Tools”)
- Filters bar (horizontal, sticky on scroll):
   - ✅ Working
   - ❌ Not Working
   - 🔥 Most Used
   - 💤 Underrated
   - Free, Limited Free, Paid
- Below filters: all tools shown in a clean, responsive grid layout

📦 Data Storage:
- Store AI tools in a JavaScript array (or JSON object) with:
  {
    name,
    description,
    status, (e.g. “Most Used”, “Not Working”)
    access, (e.g. “Free”, “Paid”)
    category,
    working: true/false,
    link,
    icon
  }

📱 Style Requirements:
- Use clean, modern fonts (e.g. Poppins or Inter)
- Dark theme as default, but include toggle logic
- Make everything mobile responsive
- Hover animations on cards and buttons
- Consistent spacing and layout for AdSense-readiness
- Allow easy scalability: new categories and tools can be added later by manually editing the JS array.

Use placeholder icons and 5–6 sample tools per category (e.g. ChatGPT, Copy.ai, Midjourney). Include 4 categories to start (Writing, Video, Coding, Design). I will add more later manually.

Include all HTML, CSS, and JS files separately inside one Replit project.

Final site should be responsive, organized, fast-loading, and expandable for up to 500+ tools in the future.
